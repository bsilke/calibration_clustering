# Beneficiary Analysis and Impact Pathway: Building Energy Benchmarking

## 1. Beneficiary Analysis

### Primary Beneficiaries (Direct Recipients)

The following groups may benefit directly from decisions informed by the clustering analysis:

| Beneficiary | Description | How They Benefit |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Building occupants in inefficient facilities** | Tenants, employees, and visitors in buildings identified as efficiency outliers | Improved indoor comfort, reduced operating costs passed through rents, healthier indoor environments following retrofits |
| **Low-income tenants in high-EUI buildings** | Residents in affordable housing or commercial spaces where energy costs burden occupants | Targeted retrofit programs reduce utility bills and improve living/working conditions |
| **Facility managers of underperforming buildings** | Operations staff responsible for buildings flagged as outliers within peer groups | Clear, fair benchmarks provide evidence to justify retrofit budgets to ownership |
| **Small building owners lacking benchmarking resources** | Independent landlords without access to sophisticated energy analysis | Peer group assignment provides actionable context without requiring in-house expertise |
| **Communities in high-emission building clusters** | Neighborhoods with concentrations of inefficient building stock | Prioritized intervention reduces localized air quality impacts from energy generation |

### Secondary Beneficiaries (Indirect Recipients)

The following groups benefit through improved systems, policies, or market conditions:

| Beneficiary | Description | How They Benefit |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Taxpayers and ratepayers** | Public funding sources for retrofit subsidies and utility efficiency programs | More efficient allocation of limited retrofit budgets; higher emission reductions per dollar spent |
| **Future building occupants** | Individuals who will inhabit retrofitted buildings in coming decades | Inherit more efficient, comfortable, and climate-resilient building stock |
| **Adjacent jurisdictions and peer cities** | Other municipalities seeking to implement benchmarking programs | Replicable methodology and peer grouping framework adaptable to other building stocks |
| **Climate and public health systems** | Broader environmental and health infrastructure | Reduced grid stress, lower peak demand, decreased emissions contributing to regional air quality and climate goals |

### Implementers (Change Agents)

The following actors will translate clustering insights into decisions and actions:

| Implementer | Role | Actions Enabled by Clustering |
|-------------|------|-------------------------------|
| **Policymakers and regulators** | Set energy performance standards and allocate public funds | Design differentiated policies by peer group; set achievable targets based on cluster-specific baselines |
| **Utility program managers** | Administer demand-side management and efficiency incentive programs | Target outreach to buildings with highest efficiency gaps; tailor rebate structures by building archetype |
| **Financial institutions** | Underwrite green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and climate risk assessments | Use cluster membership and efficiency gap as inputs to risk scoring and loan eligibility criteria |
| **Energy auditors and consultants** | Recommend retrofit measures to building owners | Prioritize audit queues by outlier status; benchmark client buildings against appropriate peer groups |
| **Building owners and asset managers** | Make capital investment decisions | Identify portfolio assets requiring intervention; justify retrofit expenditures with peer-adjusted benchmarks |

## 2. Impact Pathway Mapping

### Step 1: Analytical Outputs

The clustering analysis produces the following deliverables:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cluster assignments** | Each building assigned to one of 4–6 peer groups based on structural, operational, and climatic similarity |
| **Cluster profiles** | Characterization of each peer group by centroid values (mean temperature, modal usage type, typical building age) |
| **Efficiency outlier flags** | Buildings identified as consuming >1 standard deviation above peer-group median EUI |
| **Prioritization rankings** | Ordered lists of buildings by efficiency gap magnitude within each cluster |
| **Visualization suite** | Parallel coordinates plots, EUI boxplots by cluster, heatmaps of categorical distributions |

### Step 2: Intermediate Outcomes

The analytical outputs translate into the following near-term changes:

| Outcome | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Policy differentiation by building archetype** | Policymakers use cluster profiles to set peer-group-specific performance targets rather than one-size-fits-all standards |
| **Retrofit budget reallocation** | Subsidy programs shift funding toward clusters and individual buildings with the largest efficiency gaps |
| **Targeted outreach campaigns** | Utility programs contact owners of flagged outlier buildings with tailored efficiency recommendations |
| **Improved audit prioritization** | Energy auditors focus limited capacity on buildings most likely to benefit from intervention |
| **Enhanced green financing criteria** | Financial institutions incorporate cluster-adjusted benchmarks into loan underwriting and bond eligibility |
| **Increased stakeholder awareness** | Building owners gain visibility into how their assets compare against true peers, motivating voluntary action |

### Step 3: Long-term Impacts

The intermediate outcomes contribute to the following sustainability improvements:

| Impact Category | Expected Improvement |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Environmental: Emission reductions** | Targeted retrofits of efficiency outliers reduce operational carbon emissions from the building sector; concentration of resources on high-impact targets maximizes emission reduction per dollar invested |
| **Environmental: Grid resilience** | Reduced peak demand from retrofitted buildings decreases strain on electricity infrastructure, particularly during extreme temperature events |
| **Social: Energy affordability** | Lower energy costs for occupants of retrofitted buildings, with disproportionate benefits for low-income tenants in previously inefficient stock |
| **Social: Indoor environmental quality** | Retrofits often improve ventilation, thermal comfort, and air quality, yielding health co-benefits for occupants |
| **Economic: Resource efficiency** | Higher return on investment for retrofit programs through better targeting; reduced wasted expenditure on buildings that were already performing well |
| **Economic: Market transparency** | Fair, peer-adjusted benchmarks improve information quality in real estate markets, enabling more accurate asset valuation |

## 3. Equity and Justice Considerations

### Avoiding Harm

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Stigmatization of building types** | Certain usage types or regions may be disproportionately flagged as inefficient, leading to reputational harm or market devaluation | Report efficiency gaps relative to peer group, not absolute rankings; emphasize that outlier status reflects improvement opportunity, not failure |
| **Reinforcing existing biases** | If training data reflects historical underinvestment in certain communities, clusters may perpetuate those patterns | Examine cluster composition for demographic disparities; ensure intervention prioritization does not systematically exclude underserved areas |
| **Punitive policy applications** | Benchmarking results could be used to penalize building owners rather than support improvement | Advocate for incentive-based rather than penalty-based policy frameworks; provide technical assistance alongside flagging |
| **Data privacy concerns** | Building-level energy data may reveal occupancy patterns or business operations | Aggregate results to cluster level for public reporting; restrict building-level data to authorized implementers |

### Promoting Justice

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Prioritize historically underserved communities** | Weight intervention prioritization to favor buildings in low-income neighborhoods or areas with legacy pollution burdens |
| **Ensure accessibility of insights** | Translate technical cluster profiles into plain-language guidance for small building owners without analytical capacity |
| **Design for burden reduction** | Structure retrofit programs to minimize administrative burden for under-resourced building owners (e.g., streamlined applications for flagged outliers) |
| **Include community voice in interpretation** | Engage community stakeholders in validating whether cluster profiles and intervention priorities reflect local knowledge and needs |

### Power Dynamics

| Consideration | Approach |
|---------------|----------|
| **Control of results** | Clustering outputs should be made available to building owners and tenants, not only to regulators and financial institutions |
| **Agency of beneficiaries** | Provide building owners with actionable recommendations alongside outlier flags; avoid "naming and shaming" without support pathways |
| **Transparency of methodology** | Document clustering methodology, feature weights, and outlier thresholds publicly to enable scrutiny and contestation |
| **Feedback mechanisms** | Establish channels for building owners to challenge peer group assignments or report data errors affecting their classification |

## 4. Summary

| Component | Key Elements |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Primary beneficiaries** | Building occupants in inefficient facilities, low-income tenants, facility managers, small building owners, affected communities |
| **Secondary beneficiaries** | Taxpayers, future occupants, peer jurisdictions, climate/health systems |
| **Implementers** | Policymakers, utility program managers, financial institutions, energy auditors, building owners |
| **Analytical outputs** | Cluster assignments, peer profiles, outlier flags, priority rankings, visualizations |
| **Intermediate outcomes** | Policy differentiation, budget reallocation, targeted outreach, improved audit prioritization, enhanced financing criteria |
| **Long-term impacts** | Emission reductions, grid resilience, energy affordability, indoor environmental quality, resource efficiency, market transparency |
| **Equity priorities** | Avoid stigmatization and bias reinforcement; prioritize underserved communities; ensure accessibility and agency; maintain transparency |

The clustering analysis produces peer groups and efficiency flags. Implementers use these outputs to make better decisions. Better decisions lead to real-world improvements: lower emissions, reduced energy costs, and healthier buildings.
